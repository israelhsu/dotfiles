# dotfiles

Common dotfiles (Linux configuration files) are under a bare git repository in ~/.dotfiles.

To interact with this repository, use the git command:
$ /usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME <command> <command options>

This incantation is included in the "dotfiles" alias in .aliases.
